# States
Hi, I am a newcomer for using the Spirit1.
Testing with a DSO on the SPI-interface on Spirit1-MISO I always can decode a 0x52 at the first read in the initialisation sequence.
This also I get in my software.
This does not fit to any of the SPIRIT1_STATE, where expected is a 0x40 for stand by.
I am using also a IDS001V4M on USB with SPIRIT-DK. The DSO on this SPI-interface shows the same strange 0x52 at the beginning os any transfer.
I think that I am missing some of basic information.
I would be very pleased for a hint.
Regards Bernd
